	\section*{1}
	\subsection*{a)}
	First construction:\\
	S $\rightarrow$ aS $\rightarrow$ a aS $\rightarrow$ a a SS $\rightarrow$ a a Sb $\rightarrow$ a a b b\\
	Second construction:\\
	S $\rightarrow$ aS $\rightarrow$ a SS $\rightarrow$ a ab S $\rightarrow$ a a b b
	\subsection*{b)}
	$(a^{*} \cup ab)^{*} b^{*}$
	\subsection*{c)}
	S $\rightarrow$ aS | Sb | SS
	\section*{2}
	\subsection*{$\Lb{}_1$}
	S $\rightarrow$ aN | $\lambda$\\
	N $\rightarrow$ bL\\
	M $\rightarrow$ aS\\
	L $\rightarrow$ aMS\\
	
	This grammar describes the language $\Lb{}_1$ because if we take an a we also need to take n+m b and then another a before we can again take an a.
	\subsection*{$\Lb{}_2$}
	S $\rightarrow$ abS | rS | bS | bR\\
	R $\rightarrow$ rrr\\
	
	This grammar describes the language $\Lb{}_2$ because we can only take an a if we also take a b, thus giving the rule that every a should be followed directly by a b. Besides this we can put any number of r's and b's before we have to end the word using the rule bR, which ensures the word is ended with brrr.
	
	\section*{3}
	\subsection*{1)}
	This does not hold since there are languages where the complement of the language is context-free as well. An example of such a language is the simple language L = $\{a^{n}\}$, where we have $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$. Then we have the $\bar{L}$ = $\{b^{n}\}$.
	\subsection*{2)}
	This does not hold since we can find languages that are regular and their intersection is not regular. An example of is the language L = $\{a^{n}b^{n}c^{m}|m,n \geq 0\}$ and K = $\{a^{m}b^{n}c^{n}|m,n \geq 0\}$ which leads to L $\cap$ K = $\{a^{n}b^{n}c^{n}|n \geq 0\}$ which is known not to be regular.
	\section*{4}
	We first label the states in the DFA to non-terminals in the grammar.\\
	$q_0 = S, q_1 = Q, q_2 = M, q_3 = L, q_4 = N$\\\\
	Then we can define the following grammar:\\
	S $\rightarrow$ aS | bQ | $\lambda$\\ 
	Q $\rightarrow$ aS | bL\\
	L $\rightarrow$ bL | aM\\
	M $\rightarrow$ aS | bN\\
	N $\rightarrow$ aN | bN\\
